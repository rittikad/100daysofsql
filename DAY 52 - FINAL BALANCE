52 - Final Balance

You are given history of your bank account for the year 2020, each transaction was either a credit card payment or incoming transfer. 
There is a fee of holding a credit card which you have to pay every month, fee is 5 per month. 

However you are not charged for a given month if you made atleast 2 credit card payments for a cost of atleast 100 within that month. 
Note that this fee is not included in the supplied history of transactions.

You are given transactions with the follwing structure:
Table : Transactions 
Columns : amount int , transaction_date date

Each row in the table contains information about a single transaction. 
If the amount value is negative , it is a credit card payment otherwise it is an incoming transfer.
At the beginning of the year, the balance of your account was 0 . Your task is to compute the balance at the end of the year. 

Expected Output:
final_balance
-95

SOLUTION:

WITH TransactionCalculation AS
(
    SELECT
       strftime('%m',transaction_date),
       transaction_date,
        SUM
        (
            CASE
                WHEN amount < 0 THEN 1
                ELSE 0
            END
        ) AS credit_card_amount_count,
        SUM
        (
            CASE
                WHEN amount < 0 THEN amount
                ELSE 0
            END
        ) AS credit_card_amount,
        SUM
        (
            CASE
                WHEN amount > 0 THEN amount
                ELSE 0
            END
        ) AS transfer_money
    FROM Transactions
    GROUP BY 1
),
FinalBalance AS
(
    SELECT 
        COUNT(strftime('%m', transaction_date)) AS no_of_months,
        SUM(CASE
            WHEN credit_card_amount_count > 1 AND credit_card_amount >= -100 THEN credit_card_amount + transfer_money
            ELSE credit_card_amount + transfer_money - 5
        END) AS final_bal
    FROM TransactionCalculation
)

SELECT 
    final_bal - 5*(12 - no_of_months) AS final_balance
FROM FinalBalance;
