20 - Income Tax Returns

Income tax returns are supposed to file every year before due date announce by govt every year . Goverment wants to find out people who have filed late returns or people who have completely skipped filing returns. 

Write an SQL to list all the users along with the year for which they have done late filing or missed filing the returns. Create a comment column as well specifying if its a 'late return' or  'missed'.

Table: income_tax_dates(primary key : financial_year)
column name	datatype
financial_year 	varchar(4)
file_start_date date
file_due_date 	date

Table: users (primary key : user_id,financial_year)
column name	 datatype
user_id 	 int
financial_year 	 varchar(4)
return_file_date date

Expected Output:
user_id	financial_year	comment
1	FY21	        late return
1	FY22	        missed
2	FY23	        late return

SOLUTION:
WITH FinancialYears AS
(
    SELECT
        DISTINCT user_id,
        itd.financial_year,
        file_due_date
    FROM Users u
    CROSS JOIN income_tax_dates itd
)

SELECT
    fy.user_id,
    fy.financial_year,
    CASE
        WHEN return_file_date > file_due_date THEN 'late return'
        WHEN return_file_date IS NULL THEN 'missed'
    END AS comment
FROM FinancialYears fy
LEFT JOIN Users u
ON fy.user_id = u.user_id AND fy.financial_year = u.financial_year
WHERE comment IS NOT NULL;
