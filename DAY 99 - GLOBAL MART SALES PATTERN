99 - Global Mart Sales Pattern

You are tasked with analyzing the sales data of a Global Mart store chain with multiple stores across different locations. The company wants to identify the highest and lowest sales months for each location for the year 2023 to gain insights into their sales patterns. In case of a tie display the latest month. 

Tables: 
transactions (transaction_id, customer_id, store_id, transaction_date, amount)
stores (store_id, store_name, location)

Expected Output:
location	highest_sales_month	lowest_sales_month
Chicago	        2023-01	                2023-02
Los Angeles	2023-12	                2023-02
New York	2023-12	                2023-04

SOLUTION:

WITH GlobalMartSalesPattern AS 
(
    SELECT 
        location,
        CONCAT(strftime('%Y', transaction_date), '-', strftime('%m', transaction_date)) AS sales_month,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY location ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC) AS highest_sales_ranking,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY location ORDER BY SUM(amount) ASC) AS lowest_sales_ranking
    FROM transactions t
    JOIN stores s
    ON t.store_id = s.store_id
    GROUP BY location, sales_month
)
SELECT 
    location,
    MAX
    (
        CASE 
            WHEN highest_sales_ranking = 1 THEN sales_month
        END
    ) AS highest_sales_month, 
    MAX
    (
        CASE 
            WHEN lowest_sales_ranking = 1 THEN sales_month
        END
    ) AS lowest_sales_month
    FROM GlobalMartSalesPattern
    GROUP BY location;
