67 - Email Confirmation Rate

In the realm of user authentication and account verification, email confirmation plays a pivotal role in ensuring the security and validity of user accounts. Analyzing the efficiency of email confirmation processes provides insights into user engagement and the effectiveness of onboarding strategies.

You are tasked with analyzing the email confirmation process of a web application to determine the percentage of users who confirm their email addresses on the same day of registration, the next day, beyond next day and never confirmed.

Round the result to 2 decimal places and sort by confirmation percent in descending order.

Tables:
user_registration (user_id, registration_date)
email_confirmation (user_id, confirmation_date)

Expected Output:
confirm_category	percent_of_total
same day confirm	36.36
beyond next day confirm	27.27
not confirmed	        18.18
next day confirm	18.18

SOLUTION:

WITH EmailConfirmationRate AS 
(
    SELECT 
    ur.user_id,
    CASE
        WHEN registration_date IS NOT NULL AND confirmation_date IS NULL THEN 'not confirmed'
        WHEN registration_date = confirmation_date THEN 'same day confirm'
        WHEN JULIANDAY(confirmation_date) - JULIANDAY(registration_date) = 1 THEN 'next day confirm'
        ELSE 'beyond next day confirm'
    END AS confirm_category,
    SUM
    (
        CASE
            WHEN registration_date IS NOT NULL AND confirmation_date IS NULL THEN 1
            WHEN registration_date = confirmation_date THEN 1
            WHEN JULIANDAY(confirmation_date) - JULIANDAY(registration_date) = 1 THEN 1
            ELSE 1
        END
    ) AS total,
    registration_date,
    confirmation_date,
    (SELECT COUNT(user_id) FROM user_registration) AS total_count_of_users
FROM user_registration ur
LEFT JOIN email_confirmation ec
ON ur.user_id = ec.user_id
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT
    confirm_category,
    ROUND(SUM(total) * 100.0 / total_count_of_users,2) AS percent_of_total
FROM EmailConfirmationRate
GROUP BY confirm_category
ORDER BY percent_of_total DESC;
