69 - On Time Delivery

Zomato introduced an "on-time delivery" policy where they refund the total order amount or 200 rupees, whichever is lower, in case of late delivery. Additionally, customers have the option to choose whether they want the refund for late orders or if they are okay with the delay and do not want any refund.

Write a SQL query to calculate the return percent revenue and on time order delivery percent for Zomato for each city, considering the refund policy and customer preferences. Round the percentages to 2 decimal places.

Table: orders (primary key : order_id)
ColumnName	      DataType
order_id	        INT
city	              VARCHAR(50)
actual_delivery_time	INT
expected_delivery_time  INT
order_amount	        INT
customer_preference   VARCHAR(20)
 

Expected Output:
city	return_amount_percent	ontime_orders_percent
Delhi	25.0	                20.0
Mumbai	30.23	                40.0

                ELSE 0
            END
        ) AS return_amount,
        SUM(order_amount) AS total_order_amount_per_city,
        COUNT(city) AS total_orders_per_city
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY city
)
SELECT
    city,
    ROUND(return_amount * 100.0 / total_order_amount_per_city,2) AS return_amount_percent,
    ROUND(ontime_orders * 100.0 / total_orders_per_city,2) AS ontime_orders_percent
    FROM TotalOrdersPerCity
    GROUP BY city;
