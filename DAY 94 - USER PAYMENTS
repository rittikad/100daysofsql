94 - User Payments

You are provided with two tables, payments and users. The payments table contains records of transactions between users, with a column payment_state indicating whether the payment was successful or failed. The users table contains information about user sign-up dates.

Your task is to determine the customers who meet the following criterian within 30 days of signup.

1- customer should not have more than 1 failed transactions.

2- customer should have sent payments atleast 2 times. 

3- customer should have a combined successful sending and receiving volume exceeding amount of 20000

Output should display user_id and total transaction amount combined(failed/success) within 30 days of signup. Order by customer id.

Tables: 
users (id, signup_date)
payments (sender_id, recipient_id, payment_date, state, amount)

Expected Output:

user_id	total_transaction
2	34000

SOLUTION:

WITH SentUserPayments AS
(
    SELECT
        id,
        SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'failed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS number_of_failed_transactions,
        SUM(CASE WHEN payment_date IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS number_of_sent_payments,
        SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'success' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS successful_sending_amount
    FROM users u
    JOIN payments p
    ON u.id = p.sender_id
    WHERE payment_date > signup_date AND payment_date <= DATE(signup_date, '+30 days')
    GROUP BY id
    HAVING number_of_failed_transactions <= 1 AND number_of_sent_payments >= 2
),
ReceiverUserPayments AS
(
    SELECT
        id,
        SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'success' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS successful_receiving_amount
    FROM users u
    JOIN payments p
    ON u.id = p.recipient_id
    WHERE payment_date > signup_date AND payment_date <= DATE(signup_date, '+30 days')
    GROUP BY id
)

SELECT 
    sup.id,
    successful_sending_amount + successful_receiving_amount AS total_transactions
FROM ReceiverUserPayments rup
JOIN SentUserPayments sup
ON rup.id = sup.id
WHERE total_transactions > 20000;
