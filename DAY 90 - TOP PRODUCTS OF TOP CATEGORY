90 - Top Products of Top Category

You are analyzing sales data from an e-commerce platform, which includes information about orders placed for various products across different categories. Each order contains details such as the order ID, order date, product ID, category, and amount.

Write an SQL to identify the top 3 products within the top-selling category based on total sales. The top-selling category is determined by the sum of the amounts sold for all products within that category. Sort the output by products sales in descending order.

Table: orders (order_id, order_date, product_id, category, amount)

Expected Output:
product_id	category	total_sales
2	        Furniture	800
1	        Furniture	690
4	        Furniture	500

SOLUTION:

WITH TopSellingCategory AS
(
    SELECT 
        category,
        SUM(amount) AS sales
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY category
    ORDER BY sales DESC
    LIMIT 1
),

TopThreeProducts AS
(
    SELECT 
        product_id,
        category,
        SUM(amount) AS total_sales
    FROM orders
    WHERE category = (SELECT category FROM TopSellingCategory)
    GROUP BY product_id
    ORDER BY total_sales DESC
    LIMIT 3 
)

SELECT * FROM TopThreeProducts;
