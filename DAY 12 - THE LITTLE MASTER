Sachin Tendulkar - Also known as little master. You are given runs scored by Sachin in his first 10 matches. You need to write an SQL to get match number when he completed 500 runs and his batting average at the end of 10 matches.

Batting Average = (Total runs scored) / (no of times batsman got out)
Round the result to 2 decimal places.

Table: sachin(primary key : match_no)
column name	datatype
match_no	   int
runs_scored	   int
status	        varchar(10) 

Expected Output:
match_no	batting_average
8	        70.33

SOLUTION:

WITH TheLittleMaster AS
(
    SELECT
        match_no,
        SUM(runs_scored) OVER(ORDER BY match_no) AS running_total,
        (SELECT ROUND(SUM(runs_scored) * 1.0 /
        SUM
        (
            CASE
                WHEN status = 'out' THEN 1
                ELSE 0
            END
        ) ,2) FROM sachin) AS batting_average
    FROM sachin
)

SELECT
    match_no,
    batting_average
FROM TheLittleMaster
WHERE running_total BETWEEN 500 and 600;
