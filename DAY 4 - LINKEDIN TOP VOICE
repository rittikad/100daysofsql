LinkedIn is a professional social networking app. They want to give top voice badge to their best creators to encourage them to create more quality content. A creator qualifies for the badge if he/she satisfies following criteria. 

1- Creator should have more then 50k followers.

2- Creator should have more than 100k impressions on the posts that they published in the month of Dec-2023.

3- Creator should have published atleast 3 posts in Dec-2023.

Write a SQL to get the list of top voice creators name along with no of posts and impressions by them in the month of Dec-2023.

Table: creators(primary key : creator_id)
column name	data type 
creator_id 	int
creator_name 	varchar(20)
followers 	int

Table: posts(primary key : post_id)
column name	data type 
creator_id 	int
post_id 	varchar(3)

Example output:

Ankit Bansal	3	         132000

WITH linkedin_top_voice(creator_name,no_of_posts,total_impressions) AS
(
    SELECT 
        creator_name,
        COUNT(post_id) AS no_of_posts,
        SUM(impressions) AS total_impressions
    FROM creators c
    JOIN posts p
    ON c.creator_id = p.creator_id
    WHERE (followers > 50000) AND 
    (strftime('%Y', publish_date) = '2023') AND 
    (strftime('%m', publish_date) = '12')
    GROUP BY creator_name
    HAVING (no_of_posts >= 3) AND 
    (total_impressions > 100000)
)
SELECT * FROM linkedin_top_voice;
