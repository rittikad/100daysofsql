59 - Service Downtime

You are a DevOps engineer responsible for monitoring the health and status of various services in your organization's infrastructure. Your team conducts canary tests on each service every minute to ensure their reliability and performance. As part of your responsibilities, you need to develop a SQL to identify any service that experiences continuous downtime for atleast 5 minutes so that team can find the root cause and fix the issue.

Table:service_status 
column name	datatype
service_name 	varchar(20)
updated_time 	datetime
status 	        varchar(5)
 
Expected Output:
service_name	down_start_time	        down_end_time	        down_minutes
hdfs	        2024-03-06 10:02:00	2024-03-06 10:07:00	6
hive	        2024-03-06 10:03:00	2024-03-06 10:07:00	5

SOLUTION:

WITH ServiceTime AS
(
    SELECT
        service_name,
        updated_time,
        status,
        LEAD(status) OVER(PARTITION BY service_name) AS lead_status
    FROM service_status
    GROUP BY service_name, updated_time
),
ServiceDowntime AS
(
    SELECT 
        service_name,
        MIN(CASE WHEN status = 'down' AND lead_status = 'down' THEN updated_time END) AS down_start_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN status = 'down' AND lead_status = 'up' THEN updated_time END) AS down_end_time
    FROM ServiceTime
    GROUP BY service_name, status
    HAVING down_start_time IS NOT NULL AND down_end_time IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
    service_name, 
    down_start_time,
    down_end_time,
    strftime('%M',down_end_time) - strftime('%M',down_start_time) + 1  AS down_mins
FROM ServiceDowntime
WHERE down_mins >= 5;
