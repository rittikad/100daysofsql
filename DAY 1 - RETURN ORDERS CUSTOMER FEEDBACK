1 - Return Orders Customer Feedback

Namastekart, an e-commerce company, has observed a notable surge in return orders recently. They suspect that a specific group of customers may be responsible for a significant portion of these returns. To address this issue, their initial goal is to identify customers who have returned more than 50% of their orders. This way, they can proactively reach out to these customers to gather feedback.

For instance, if a customer named ABC has placed 4 orders and returned 3 of them, they should be included in the output. On the other hand, if a customer named XYZ has placed 5 orders but only returned 2, they should not be included in the output. Write an SQL to find list of customers along with their return percent(Round to 2 decimal places).

Table: orders (primary key : order_id)
column name	datatype
order_id	int
order_date	date
customer_name	varchar(20)
sales	        int

Table: returns (primary key : order_id)
column name	datatype
order_id	int
return_date	date

Example Input

orders
order_id	order_date	customer_name	sales
1	        2023-01-01	Alexa	        1239
2	        2023-01-02	Alexa	        1239
3	        2023-01-03	Alexa	        1239
4	        2023-01-03	Alexa	        1239

6	        2023-01-02	Ramesh	      1239
7	        2023-01-03	Ramesh	      1239

returns
order_id	return_date
1	        2023-01-02

3	        2023-01-05
7	        2023-01-10
 

Expected Output:

customer_name	Return_Percent
Alexa	        75.0

SOLUTION:

WITH totalOrders AS
(
    SELECT 
        customer_name,
        COUNT(*) AS total_orders
    FROM orders o
    LEFT JOIN returns r
    ON o.order_id = r.order_id
    GROUP BY customer_name
),
returnOrders AS 
(
    SELECT 
        customer_name,
        COUNT(*) AS total_return_orders
    FROM orders o
    JOIN returns r
    ON o.order_id = r.order_id
    GROUP BY customer_name
)

SELECT 
    t.customer_name,
    (total_return_orders * 100.0)/total_orders AS Return_Percent
FROM returnOrders ro
JOIN totalOrders t
ON ro.customer_name = t.customer_name
WHERE (total_return_orders * 100.0)/total_orders > 50;
