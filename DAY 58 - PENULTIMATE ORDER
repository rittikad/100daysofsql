58 - Penultimate Order

You are a data analyst working for an e-commerce company, responsible for analyzing customer orders to gain insights into their purchasing behavior. Your task is to write a SQL query to retrieve the details of the penultimate order for each customer. However, if a customer has placed only one order, you need to retrieve the details of that order instead.

Table: orders (primary key : order_id)
column name	datatype
order_id	int
order_date	date
customer_name	varchar(20)
product_name	varchar(20)
sales	        int
 
Expected Output:
order_id	order_date	customer_name	product_name
2	        2023-01-02	Alexa	        boAt
6	        2023-01-03	Neha	        Dress
4	        2023-01-01	Ramesh	        Titan

SOLUTION:

WITH PenultimateOrder AS
(
    SELECT
        order_id,
        order_date,
        customer_name,
        product_name,
        COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_name) AS no_of_orders,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_name ORDER BY order_date DESC) AS row_num
FROM orders
)

SELECT 
    order_id,
    order_date,
    customer_name,
    product_name
FROM PenultimateOrder
WHERE row_num = 2 OR no_of_orders = 1;
