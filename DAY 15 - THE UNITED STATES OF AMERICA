15 - The United States of America

In some poorly designed UI applications, there's often a lack of data input restrictions. For instance, in a free text field for the country, users might input variations such as 'USA,' 'United States of America,' or 'US.'

Suppose we have survey data from individuals in the USA about their job satisfaction, rated on a scale of 1 to 5. Write a SQL query to count the number of respondents for each rating on the scale. Additionally, include the country name in the format that occurs most frequently in that scale.

Table: survey (primary key : name)
column name	        datatype
name 	                varchar(10)
job_satisfaction 	int
country 	        varchar(20)

Expected output:
job_satisfaction	country	            number_of_respondents
4	                USA	            3
5	                United States	    4

SOLUTION:

WITH USA AS
(
    SELECT 
        job_satisfaction,
        country,
        COUNT(*) AS count_of_respondents,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY job_satisfaction ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS row_num
    FROM survey
    GROUP BY job_satisfaction,country
)

SELECT 
    job_satisfaction,
    country,
    SUM(count_of_respondents) AS number_of_respondents
FROM USA
GROUP BY job_satisfaction
