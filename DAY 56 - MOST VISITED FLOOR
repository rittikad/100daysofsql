56 - Most Visited Floor

You are a facilities manager at a corporate office building, responsible for tracking employee visits, floor preferences, and resource usage within the premises. The office building has multiple floors, each equipped with various resources such as desks, computers, monitors, and other office supplies.

You have a database table named entries that stores information about employee visits to the office building. Each record in the table represents a visit by an employee and includes details such as their name, the floor they visited, and the resources they used during their visit.

Input Table: entries:
emp_name	address		floor	resources
Ankit		Bangalore	1	CPU
Ankit		Bangalore	1	CPU
Ankit		Bangalore	2	DESKTOP
Bikaas		Bangalore	2	DESKTOP
Bikaas		Bangalore	2	DESKTOP
Bikaas		Bangalore	1	MONITOR
 
Write an SQL query to retrieve the total visits, most visited floor, and resources used by each employee.
Expected Output:
emp_name	total_visits	most_visited_floor	resources_used
Ankit	         3	         1	         	CPU,DESKTOP
Bikaas	         3	         2	         	DESKTOP,MONITOR

SOLUTION:
WITH TotalVisits AS
(
    SELECT
    emp_name,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT resources) AS resources_used,
    COUNT(*) AS total_visits
FROM entries
GROUP BY emp_name
),
MostVisitedFloor AS 
(
    SELECT
    emp_name,
    floor,
    COUNT(*) AS total_visits_per_floor
FROM entries
GROUP BY emp_name, floor
)
SELECT
    mvf.emp_name,
    total_visits,
    CASE 
        WHEN MAX(total_visits_per_floor) THEN floor
    END AS most_visited_floor,
    resources_used
FROM TotalVisits tv
JOIN MostVisitedFloor mvf
ON tv.emp_name = mvf.emp_name
GROUP BY mvf.emp_name
