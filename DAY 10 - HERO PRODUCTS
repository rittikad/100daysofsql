Table: orders (primary key : order_id)
column name	datatype
order_id	int
product_id	varchar(20)
category	varchar(10)
unit_price	int

WITH hero_products(category,product_id,d_r) AS
(
    SELECT 
        category,
        product_id,
        DENSE_RANK() 
        OVER(
            PARTITION BY category 
            ORDER BY SUM(quantity) DESC,
            SUM(quantity * unit_price) DESC)
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY category, product_id
)

SELECT 
    category,
    product_id
FROM hero_products
