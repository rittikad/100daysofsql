1- Employees who work for more than 8 hours a day for atleast 3 days in a week. 

2- Employees who work for more than 10 hours a day for atleast 2 days in a week. 

You are given the login and logout timings of all the employess for a given week. Write a SQL to find all the workaholic employees along with the criterion that they are satisfying (1,2 or both).

Table: employees(primary key : emp_id ,login)
column name	data type 
emp_id 	        int
login 	        datetime
logout 	        datetime
 
Example Output:
emp_id	criterian
100	1
200	2
300	both

SOLUTION:

WITH workaholicEmployees AS
(
    SELECT 
        emp_id,
        SUM
        (
            CASE 
                WHEN (strftime('%s', logout) - strftime('%s', login)) / 3600 >= 8 THEN 1
                ELSE 0
            END
        ) AS cr_1,
        SUM
        (
            CASE 
                WHEN (strftime('%s', logout) - strftime('%s', login)) / 3600 >= 10 THEN 1
                ELSE 0
            END
        ) AS cr_2
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY emp_id
)
SELECT 
    emp_id,
    CASE 
        WHEN cr_1 > 2 AND cr_2 > 1 THEN 'both'
        WHEN cr_1 > 2 THEN 1
        WHEN cr_2 > 1 THEN 2
    END AS criterian
FROM workaholicEmployees;
