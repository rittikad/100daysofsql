85 - Child and Parents

You are tasked to determine the mother and father's name for each child based on the given data. The people table provides information about individuals, including their names and genders. The relations table specifies parent-child relationships, linking each child (c_id) to their parent (p_id). Each parent is identified by their ID, and their gender is used to distinguish between mothers (F) and fathers (M).

Write an SQL query to retrieve the names of each child along with the names of their respective mother and father, if available. If a child has only one parent listed in the relations table, the query should still include that parent's name and leave the other parent's name as NULL. Order the output by child name.

Tables: 
people(id, name, gender)
relations (c_id,p_id)

Expected Output:
child_name	mother_name	  father_name
Dimartino	Hansard	 
Hawbaker	Days	          Blackston
Keffer	        Hansel	          Canty
Mozingo	        Criss	          Nolf
Waugh	 	                  Tong

SOLUTION:

WITH MotherChildRelation AS 
(
    SELECT 
        name AS child_name,
        (SELECT
            CASE
                WHEN gender = 'F' THEN name
            END
        FROM people 
        WHERE id = p_id) AS mother_name
    FROM people p
    JOIN relations r
    ON id = c_id
    GROUP BY child_name
    ORDER BY child_name
),

FatherChildRelation AS 
(
    SELECT 
        name AS child_name,
        (SELECT
            CASE
                WHEN gender = 'M' THEN name
            END
        FROM people 
        WHERE id = p_id) AS father_name
    FROM people p
    RIGHT JOIN relations r
    ON id = c_id
    GROUP BY child_name
    ORDER BY child_name
)

SELECT
    mcr.child_name,
    mother_name,
    father_name
FROM MotherChildRelation mcr
JOIN FatherChildRelation fcr
ON mcr.child_name = fcr.child_name;
