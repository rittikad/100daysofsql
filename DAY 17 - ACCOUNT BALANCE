DAY 17 - Account Balance

You are given a list of users and their opening account balance along with the trasaction done by them. Write a SQL to calculate their account balance at the end of all the transactions. Please note that users can do transactions among themselves as well. 

Table: users(primary key : user_id)

column name	datatype
user_id 	int
username 	varchar(10)
opening_balance 	int
 
Table: transactions (primary key : id)
column name	datatype
id	  int
from_userid 	int
to_userid  	int
amount 	 int
 
Expected Output:
user_id	final_balance
Ankit	  2000
Rahul	  10200
Amit	  2800
Agam	  7500

SOLUTION:

WITH UserOpeningBalance AS
(
    SELECT 
        DISTINCT user_id,
        username,
        opening_balance
    FROM users
    LEFT JOIN transactions
    ON user_id = from_userid
),
CreditBalance AS
(
    SELECT 
        username,
        CASE
            WHEN user_id = to_userid THEN opening_balance + SUM(amount)
            ELSE opening_balance
        END AS credit_balance
    FROM UserOpeningBalance
    LEFT JOIN transactions t
    ON user_id = to_userid
    GROUP BY username
),
DebitBalance AS
(
    SELECT 
    user_id,
    username,
    opening_balance,
    CASE
        WHEN user_id = from_userid THEN opening_balance - SUM(amount)
        ELSE opening_balance
    END AS debit_balance
FROM UserOpeningBalance upb
LEFT JOIN transactions 
ON user_id = from_userid
GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT 
    db.username AS user_id,
    (credit_balance + debit_balance - db.opening_balance) AS final_balance
FROM DebitBalance db
JOIN CreditBalance cb
ON db.username = cb.username;
