84 - Customer Purchase

Suppose you are analyzing the purchase history of customers in an e-commerce platform. Your task is to identify customers who have bought different products on different dates.

Write an SQL to find customers who have bought different products on different dates,  Means product purchased on a given day is not repeated on any other day by the customer. Also note that for the customer to qualify he should have made purchases on atleast 2 distinct dates. Output should contain customer id and number of products bought by the customer.

Table: purchase_history (userid , productid, purchasedate )

Expected Output:
userid	cnt_products
1	 3
4	 2

SOLUTION:

WITH DistinctDates AS
(
    SELECT
        userid,
        COUNT(productid) AS cnt_products
    FROM purchase_history
    GROUP BY userid
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT purchasedate) > 1
),

RepeatedProducts AS
(
    SELECT
        userid,
        COUNT(*) AS repeated_products
    FROM purchase_history
    GROUP BY userid, productid
)
SELECT
    dd.userid,
    cnt_products
FROM DistinctDates dd
JOIN RepeatedProducts rp
ON dd.userid <> rp.userid
WHERE repeated_products > 1;
