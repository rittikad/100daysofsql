14 - Uber Rides

A profit ride for a Uber driver is considered when the start location and start time of a ride exactly match with the previous ride's end location and end time. 

Write an SQL to calculate total number of rides and total profit rides by each driver.

Table: drivers(primary key : id , start_time )
column name	datatype
id 	        varchar(10)
start_time 	time
end_time 	time
start_loc 	varchar(1)
end_loc 	varchar(1)

Expected output :
id	total_rides	profit_rides
dri_1	5	        1
dri_2	2	        0

SOLUTION:

WITH profitRides AS 
(
    SELECT 
    id,
    LAG(end_time) OVER(PARTITION BY id) AS previous_ride_end_time,
    LAG(end_loc) OVER(PARTITION BY id) AS previous_ride_end_loc,
    start_time,
    start_loc
FROM drivers
)

SELECT 
    id,
    COUNT(*) AS total_rides,
    SUM
    (
        CASE 
            WHEN start_loc = previous_ride_end_loc AND
            start_time = previous_ride_end_time THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END
    ) AS profit_rides
FROM profitRides
GROUP BY id;
