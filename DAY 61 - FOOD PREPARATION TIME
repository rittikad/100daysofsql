You're analyzing the efficiency of food delivery on Zomato, focusing on the time taken by restaurants to prepare orders. Total food delivery time for an order is a combination of food preparation time + time taken by rider to deliver the order. 

Write an SQL to calculate average food preparation time(in minutes) for each restaurant . Round the average to 2 decimal points and sort the output in increasing order of avg time. 

Table: orders (primary key : order_id)
column name	         datatype
order_id	         int
restaurant_id 	         int
order_time	         time
expected_delivery_time 	 time
actual_delivery_time 	 time
rider_delivery_mins 	 int
 
Expected Output:

restaurant_id	avg_food_prep_mins
103	          27.67
102	          28.67
101	          29.5

SOLUTION:

SELECT
    restaurant_id,
    ROUND(AVG(ABS((julianday(actual_delivery_time)-julianday(order_time))*24*60 - rider_delivery_mins)),2) AS avg_food_prep_mins
FROM orders
GROUP BY restaurant_id
ORDER BY avg_food_prep_mins;
