60 - Fake Ratings

As an analyst at Amazon, you are responsible for ensuring the integrity of product ratings on the platform. Fake ratings can distort the perception of product quality and mislead customers. To maintain trust and reliability, you need to identify potential fake ratings that deviate significantly from the average ratings for each product.

Write an SQL query to identify the single rating that is farthest (in absolute value) from the average rating value for each product.

Table : product_ratings (primary key:rating_id)
column name	datatype
rating_id	int
product_id 	int
user_id 	int
rating 	        decimal(2,1)
 
Expected Output:
rating_id	product_id	user_id	  rating
5	        101	        1005	    3.2
6	        102	        1006	    4.7

SOLUTION:

WITH AverageRating AS 
(
    SELECT
        rating_id,
        product_id,
        user_id,
        rating,
        ROUND(AVG(rating) OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY product_id),1) AS avg_rating,
        ABS(ROUND(AVG(rating) OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY product_id),1) - rating) AS fake_rating
FROM product_ratings
)

SELECT 
    rating_id,
    product_id,
    user_id,
    CASE
        WHEN MAX(fake_rating) THEN rating 
    END AS rating
FROM AverageRating
GROUP BY product_id;
