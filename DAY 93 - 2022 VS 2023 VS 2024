93 - 2022 vs 2023 vs 2024

You are tasked with analyzing the sales growth of products over the years 2022, 2023, and 2024. Your goal is to identify months where the sales for a product have consistently increased from 2022 to 2023 and from 2023 to 2024.

Your task is to write an SQL query to generate a report that includes the sales for each product at the month level for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024. However, you should only include product and months combination where the sales have consistently increased from 2022 to 2023 and from 2023 to 2024.

Table: orders(order_id, customer_id, order_date, product_id, sales)

Expected Output:
product_id	order_month	sales_2022	sales_2023	sales_2024
1	          02	          280	          520	          730
2	          07	          225	          325	          525
3	          09	          90	          190	          290

SOLUTION:

WITH TotalSales AS 
(
    SELECT
        product_id,
        strftime('%Y', order_date) AS order_year,
        strftime('%m', order_date) AS order_month,
        SUM(sales) AS total_sales
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY product_id, order_year, order_month
),
SalesByYear AS 
(
    SELECT
        product_id,
        order_month,
        SUM
            (
                CASE
                    WHEN order_year = '2022' THEN total_sales 
                    ELSE 0 
                END
            ) AS sales_2022,
            SUM
            (
                CASE
                    WHEN order_year = '2023' THEN total_sales 
                    ELSE 0 
                END
            ) AS sales_2023,
            SUM
            (
                CASE
                    WHEN order_year = '2024' THEN total_sales 
                    ELSE 0 
                END
            ) AS sales_2024
        FROM TotalSales
        GROUP BY product_id,order_month
)

SELECT
    *
FROM SalesByYear
WHERE sales_2022 < sales_2023 AND sales_2023 < sales_2024;
