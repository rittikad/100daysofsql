86 - Consistent Growth

In a financial analysis project, you are tasked with identifying companies that have consistently increased their revenue by at least 25% every year. You have a table named revenue that contains information about the revenue of different companies over several years.

Your goal is to find companies whose revenue has increased by at least 25% every year consecutively. So for example If a company's revenue has increased by 25% or more for three consecutive years but not for the fourth year, it will not be considered.

Write an SQL query to retrieve the names of companies that meet the criteria mentioned above along with total lifetime revenue.

Table : revenue (company_id, year, revenue)

Expected Output:
company_id	total_revenue
1	        841250
4	        1860000

SOLUTION:

WITH NextYearRevenue AS
(
    SELECT
        company_id,
        year,
        revenue,
        LEAD(revenue) OVER(PARTITION BY company_id) AS next_year_revenue
FROM revenue
),
ConsistentGrowth AS
(
    SELECT
        company_id,
        COUNT(*) AS total_number_of_years,
        SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue,
        SUM(CASE WHEN (next_year_revenue - revenue) * 100 / revenue >= 25 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_revenue_increase_by_atleast_25
FROM NextYearRevenue
GROUP BY company_id
HAVING total_number_of_years = total_revenue_increase_by_atleast_25 + 1 
)

SELECT 
   company_id,
   total_revenue
FROM ConsistentGrowth;
