2 - Best Employee Award

NCS (Namaste Consultancy Services) wants to award employees based on number of projects completed by each individual each month.  Write an SQL to find best employee for each month along with number of projects completed by him/her in that month.

Table: projects(primary key : project_id)

column name      	data type 
project id	        int
employee_name	        varchar(20)
project_completion_date	date

Example Input
projects
project_id	employee_name	project_completion_date
101	        Shilpa	        2023-01-03
102	        Shilpa	        2023-01-15
103	        Shilpa	        2023-01-22
104	        Rahul	        2023-01-05
 
Expected Output:
employee_name	year_month	no_of_completed_projects
Shilpa	        202301	        3

SOLUTION:

WITH BestEmployeeAward AS
(
    SELECT
        employee_name,
        CONCAT(strftime('%Y', project_completion_date),strftime('%m', project_completion_date) )  AS year_month,
        COUNT(*) AS no_of_completed_projects
    FROM projects
    GROUP BY year_month, employee_name
)

SELECT 
    employee_name,
    year_month,
    MAX(no_of_completed_projects) AS no_of_completed_projects
FROM BestEmployeeAward
GROUP BY year_month
