71 - Customer Full Trip

Your task is to write a SQL query to generate a trip ID for each customer based on the hotel bookings data. In a single trip, a customer can check in and check out at multiple hotels. However, if the check-in date at a hotel is within 1 day of the previous check-out date, it will be considered as the same trip. For example in below sample data of hotelbookings table:

CustomerID 	HotelID 	CheckinDate 	CheckoutDate 
1	        101	        2024-01-01	2024-01-03
1	        102	        2024-01-04	2024-01-06
1	        103	        2024-01-06	2024-01-09
1	        104	        2024-01-12	2024-01-19
The first 3 bookings will be considered in the same trip and last booking will be a new trip.

Write an SQL to genrate trip numbers starting from 1 for each customer, trip start date and trip end date.

Expected Output:
CustomerID 	trip_number	trip_start_date	  trip_end_date
1	        1	        2024-01-01	   2024-01-09
1	        2	        2024-01-12	   2024-01-19
2	        1	        2024-02-01	   2024-02-06
2	        2	        2024-02-10	   2024-02-12
3	        1	        2024-02-09	   2024-02-13

SOLUTION:

WITH CustomerFullTrip AS
(
    SELECT 
        CustomerID,
        CheckinDate AS trip_start_date,
        CheckoutDate AS trip_end_date, 
        COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY CustomerID) AS count_trips,
        LEAD(CheckinDate) OVER(PARTITION BY CustomerID) AS lead_check_in_date
    FROM hotelbookings
),
CalculateTripNumber AS
(
    SELECT
        CustomerID,
        CASE
            WHEN lead_check_in_date -  trip_end_date <= 1 OR count_trips = 1 THEN 1
            ELSE 2
        END AS trip_number,
        trip_start_date,
        trip_end_date
FROM CustomerFullTrip
)

SELECT
    CustomerID,
    trip_number,
    CASE
        WHEN COUNT(trip_number) > 1 THEN MIN(trip_start_date)
        ELSE trip_start_date
    END AS trip_start_date,
    CASE
        WHEN COUNT(trip_number) > 1 THEN MAX(trip_end_date)
        ELSE trip_end_date
    END AS trip_end_date
FROM CalculateTripNumber
GROUP BY CustomerID,trip_number;
