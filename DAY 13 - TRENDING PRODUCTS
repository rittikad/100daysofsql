13 - Trending Products

Amazon wants to find out the Trending products for each month. Trending products are those for which any given month sales is more than the sum of previous 2 months sales for that product.

Please note that for first 2 months of operations this metrics does not make sense. So output should start from 3rd month only.  Assume that each product has atleast 1 sales each month.

Table: orders (primary key : order_month, product_id)
column name	datatype
order_month	date
product_id	varchar(5)
sales	        int

Expected Output:
order_month	product_id
202303	        p1
202304	        p1
202304	        p2

SOLUTION:

SELECT 
    order_month,
    product_id
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_month, product_id
HAVING SUM(sales) > 
(SELECT 
    SUM(sales) + 
    (SELECT 
        SUM(sales) 
    FROM orders 
    GROUP BY order_month - 2, product_id)
FROM orders 
GROUP BY order_month - 1) 
AND COUNT(sales) > 0
