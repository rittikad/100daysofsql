7 - Lift Overloaded (Part 1)

You are given a table of list of lifts , their maximum capacity and people along with their weight who wants to enter into it. You need to make sure maximum people enter into the lift without lift getting overloaded.

For each lift find the comma separated list of people who can be accomodated. The comma separated list should have people in the order of their weight in increasing order.

Table: lifts (primary key : id)
column name	datatype
id 	        int
capacity_kg     int

Table: lift_passengers(primary key : passenger_name )
column name	datatype
passenger_name 	varchar(10)
weight_kg 	int
lift_id 	int
 
Expected Output:
id	passenger_list
1	Adarsh,Dheeraj,Rahul
2	Priti,Neha,Vimal,Himanshi

SOLUTION:

WITH liftOverload AS
(
    SELECT 
        id,
        passenger_name,
        capacity_kg,
        SUM(weight_kg) OVER(PARTITION BY id ORDER BY weight_kg) AS running_sum_of_weights 
    FROM lifts l
    JOIN lift_passengers lp
    ON l.id = lp.lift_id
    GROUP BY id, passenger_name, capacity_kg
)

SELECT
    id,
    GROUP_CONCAT(passenger_name) AS passenger_list
FROM liftOverload
WHERE capacity_kg >= running_sum_of_weights
GROUP BY id;
